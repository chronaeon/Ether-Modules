# Modules

Quality modular documentation for Ethereum. 

Focuses of this project:

1. To help users build working Ethereum client implementations.
2. To be accurate to the facts as laid out in the Yellowpaper 
3. To be accurate to the facts in successful client implementations.
4. Including all necessary parts, and only those parts.



In the "modules" directory, you'll find single LaTeX articles covering various topics that are both *intrinsic*, and conceptually *centripetal*, to understanding the technical details which undergird Ethereum. 

This project is built and maintained primarily in LaTeX, aiming to provide complete, coherent, and modular technical documentation for Ethereum. Topic folders with the file "template.tex" in them are entries that still need to be created. 

When defining formal math operations, prefer pseudocode. Anyone can write pseudocode by imagining whatever process one is trying to describe in terms of operational steps: 

<pre>
<i>first</i> do <i>this</i>
<i>then</i> do <i>that</i>
</pre>

Links to several but not all of the various resources cited can be found in the references directory.
