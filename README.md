# Ethereology

This project is built and maintained in LaTeX, XML (using RDF and OWL), and HTML. 

##### Modules

The Modules directory contains sectionally complete and descriptively precise *chunks* of documentation; these chunks are larger than sentences, smaller than chapters, and not subject to a particular ordering of the content.

##### Revised Yellowpaper

A shorter and more concise Ethereum specification functions as a companion piece to the ontology.

##### Pseudocode

When defining formal math operations, e.g. those from the Yellowpaper, we use pseudocode. Anyone can write pseudocode by imagining whatever process you're trying to describe in terms of operational steps: 

<pre>
<i>first</i> do <i>this</i>
<i>then</i> do <i>that</i>
</pre>

##### Ontology

The Ontology classifies the data stored in each module in logical relation to its component and exponent parts.

##### Project Goals:

1. Build documentation that is broad enough to be helpful to all readers.
2. Build documentation that is deep enough to be a utility for all developers.
3. Build documentation that covers all necessary facts, and only those facts.
3. Build documentation that fosters global, systematic, and intuitive clarity about Ethereum.

Links to several but not all of the various resources cited can be found in the references directory.
