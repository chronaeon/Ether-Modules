# See-Thru Paper
The Yellowpaper's new clothes.

Project goals:

1. Organize Yellowpaper concepts systematically.

Many tools are available in LaTeX to do this including glossaries, indices, tables of contents, and tools for designing technical illustrations like mindmaps and flow-charts. For that reason, TeX has been chosen as the tool of choice for providing the maximum amount of understanding to readers trying to grok the concepts in the Yellowpaper.

2. Give formal Math equations et al. a concise, human-readable pseudocode.

This feature has been suggested more than any other from mesh-members who've taken interest in the project. I'm following the book:
"Abstract State Machines:
A Method for High-Level System Design and Analysis"
by Egon Börger and Robert Stärk,
which explains how to turn formalized mathematical descriptions of systems into pseudocode.

3. Open the editing and maintenance of this document to the developer community.

Ultimately the intention of this document is to compete, as a superior mode of description, with the current Yellowpaper. With help from the developer community, close adherence to the Yellowpaper specifications, and explicit maintaining of important data, we want to put a solid set of descriptive tools behind users who want to learn about Ethereum's core-protocol. We will be successful once we've created a document that so outperforms the current Yellowpaper that it can be effectively obsoleted.
