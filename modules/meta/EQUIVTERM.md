# Equivalent Terms

Here is list of antiquary, archaic, or esoteric ecosystem terms along with some possible replacement terms.

More intuitive and descriptive terms always supercede the less intuitive and less descriptive terms.


```
old: parent_block
new: progenitor_block
```
The word "Parent" can only apply incisively to a single block preceding some other single block, whereas a Progenitor can be a parent, grandparent, or great-great-grandparent block, without needing to change the objective referant. We take it for granted that whatever block precedes another might spontaneously be called the "parent" of that block, but most of the times in the documentation that parent block is said, progenitor block is meant and implied.


```
old: ommer
new: sibling
```
Similar to the term "parent block" ommer is archaic, and the implication "sibling of a parent" does not need to be a part of the word to intuitively make sense to the reader. We take it for granted that when, in reference to some block in Ethereum, the word "sibling" is used, the relation is implied correctly and no confusion will result from people looking for a "sibling" block instead of an "ommer" block.)
