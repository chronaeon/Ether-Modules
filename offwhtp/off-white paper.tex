	\abstract{The goal of this paper \footnote{Formally, \textit{Off-White Paper}}is to create and expand concepts from Ethereum about which, notwithstanding any earlier documentation, there may be some justified confusion. We use pseudocode rather than mathematical notation to describe Ethereum's operation, because pseudocode has many advantages when describing \textsc{Abstract State Machines},\footnote{E. Borger and S. Robert F., \textit{Abstract state machines}:\textsl{ A method for high-level system design and analysis}. 1, pp. 3-8. Springer, 2003.} like Ethereum. This paper takes an approach to describing Ethereum that focuses on clarity and approachability. Our prime source has been the Ethereum \textit{Yellowpaper}, but much supplemental knowledge has been found elsewhere and crucial points from other sources have been added as well for the reader's benefit.}

	\section{The Evolution of a Protocol}
	Over the past decade, blockchain technology has proven its longevity and veracity through a number of systems, most notably through Bitcoin, the first electronic currency of its kind to succeed. Bitcoin was successful in its mission to create currency based on a decentralized peer-to-peer Blockchain protocol, and Ethereum takes that concept a step further by creating a \textit{globally-distributed virtual machine}that can ad-hoc run such currency applications, along with any other conceivable applications or programs. Using well-established concepts from the relevant areas of computer science, like \textsc{message-passing}, \textsc{transaction processing}, and \textsc{shared-state concurrence}, the \textsl{Ethereum Protocol} creates an environment for developers to execute machine instructions with the same level of veracity and certainty as monetary transactions have on more standard Blockchains.

				\subsubsection{World State}
					Also known simply as "state", this is a \textsc{mapping} of \textbf{addresses} and \textbf{account states} (RLP data structures), this is also known as \textit{state}, or $\sigma$. This mapping is not stored on the blockchain, rather it is stored as a Merkle-Patricia \gls{trie} in a \textsc{database backend}\footnote{A database backend is accessed by users indirectly through an external application, most likely an Ethereum client; see also: \gls{state database}} that maintains a mapping of bytearrays to bytearrays.\footnote{A bytearray is specific set of bytes [data] that can be loaded into memory. It is a structure for storing binary data, e.g. the contents of a file.} The cryptographic internal data going back to the \gls{root node} represents the \textit{State} of the Blockchain at any given root, i.e. at any given \textit{time}.\footnote{This permanent data structure makes it possible to easily recall any previous state with its root hash keeping the resources off-chain and minimizing on-chain storage needs.}As a whole, the state is the sum total of database relationships in the \textbf{ \gls{state database}}. The state is an inert position on the chain, a position between prior state and post state; a block's frame of reference, and a defined set of relationships to that frame of reference.

    				\paragraph{Code Hash}
    					The \textbf{code hash} aspect of an \textsc{account's state} is the \textsc{hash of the evm code} of this account. Code hashes are \textsc{stored} in the \textbf{\gls{state database}}. Code hashes are permanent and they are executed when the address belonging to that account \textsc{receives} a message call.\footnote{A message call is any interaction with the account on-chain.}\footnote{Formal notation is $\sigma[a]_c$}\footnote{More formal notation is $\texttt{\small KEC}(\mathbf{b}) = \boldsymbol{\sigma}[a]_c$}

		\subsection{State Transition Function}
		State Transitions come about through a what is known as the State Transition Function; this is an abstraction of several operations in Ethereum which comprise the overall act of computing changes to the \textit{machine state} prior to adding them to the \textit{world state}, that is, through them being finalized and rewards applied to a given miner. \texttt{apply\_rewards} and \texttt{block\_beneficiary} are here.

			Transactions are the bread and butter of state transitions, that is of block additions, which are all the computation performed in one block. Each transaction applies the execution changes to the \textit{machine state}, a temporary state which consists of all the temporary changes in computation that must be made before a block is finalized and added to the world state.

			\subsubsection{EVM Code}

			\subsubsection{Opcodes}
				But what exactly are these computer instructions that can be executed with the same level of veracity and certainty as Bitcoin transactions? How do they come about, what makes them up, how are they kept in order, and what makes them execute? The first part of answering this question is understanding opcodes. In traditional machine architectures, you may not be introduced to working with processor-level assembly instructions for some time. In Ethereum however, they are essential to understanding the protocol because they are the most minute and subtle (yet HUGELY important) things going on in the Ethereum Blockchain at any moment, and they are the real "currency," that Ethereum trades in. I'll explain what I mean by that in a minute. First, let's go over a few Opcodes:\footnote{A full list of Opcodes is in Appendix B} \\

\begin{tabular}{|rclll|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Data} & \textbf{Opcode} & \textbf{Gas} & \textbf{In} & \textbf{Out}  \\
	\hline
	0x00 & STOP & 0 & 2 & 1 \\
	0x01 & ADD & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
	0x02 & MUL & 5 & 2 & 1 \\
	0x03 & SUB & 3 & 2 & 1 \\
	0x04 & DIV & 5 & 2 & 1 \\ 
	\hline
\end{tabular}

				\paragraph{}The STOP Opcode is used in order to stop a computation once it has completed, or to halt a computation if it has run out of gas. The ADD, MUL, SUB, and DIV operations are addition, multiplication, subtraction and division operations. The In/Out columns refer to inputs (to \texttt{machine\_state}), the state which decides every new \texttt{world\_state}.
