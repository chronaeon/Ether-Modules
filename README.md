# Ethereology

This project is built and maintained in LaTeX, XML (using RDF and OWL), and HTML. It traces the order of mechanism operations in Ethereum with complete documentation, and in minute detail. Some sections of the Ontology utilize APIs from [Etherscan](https://www.etherscan.io/apis) to track specific instances as examples.

##### Modules

The Modules directory contains sectionally complete and descriptively precise *chunks* of documentation; these chunks are larger than sentences, smaller than chapters, and non-preferential in regards to content. They are stored in the "modules" directory as XML data; the underlying directory tree follows the RDF/OWL schema.

##### Revised Yellowpaper

A shorter and more concise Ethereum specification functions as a companion piece to this website. This is written and maintained in the directory "off-whitepaper". 

##### Pseudocode

When defining formal math operations, e.g. those from the Yellowpaper, prefer pseudocode. You can write pseudocode by imagining whatever process you're trying to describe in terms of operational steps: 

<pre>
<i>first</i> do <i>this</i>
<i>then</i> do <i>that</i>
</pre>

##### Ontology

The Ontology classifies the data stored in each module in logical relation to its component and exponent parts.

##### Project Goals:

1. Build documentation that is broad enough to be helpful to all readers.
2. Build documentation that is deep enough to be a utility for all developers.
3. Build documentation that covers all necessary facts, and only those facts.
3. Build documentation that fosters global, systematic, and intuitive clarity about Ethereum.

Links to several but not all of the various resources cited can be found in the references directory.
