# Modules

Complete, coherent, and modular documentation for Ethereum. 

This project is built and maintained primarily in LaTeX. Folders in the modules/ directory that contain the file "template.tex" represent topical entries which have not yet been written. 

Focuses of this project:

1. To help users build working Ethereum client implementations.
2. To include all necessary facts, and only those facts.
3. To remove obstacles against understanding which exist in the current protocol specification.
4. To re-word, re-phrase, or re-identify concepts and terms which are not intuitively clear, to make them intuitively clear.

In the "modules" directory, you'll find single LaTeX articles covering various topics that are both *intrinsic*, and conceptually *centripetal*, to understanding the technical details which undergird Ethereum. 

A partially complete version of a revised Yellowpaper is being constructed in: offwhtp/off-whitepaper.pdf

When defining formal math operations, prefer pseudocode. Anyone can write pseudocode by imagining whatever process one is trying to describe in terms of operational steps: 

<pre>
<i>first</i> do <i>this</i>
<i>then</i> do <i>that</i>
</pre>

Links to several but not all of the various resources cited can be found in the references directory.
